# Image Classification of Chicken Health Using VGG16 Model
This project utilizes an updated VGG16 deep learning model for the classification of fecal images from chickens. The goal is to distinguish between healthy chickens and chickens suffering from Coccidiosis disease based on these images.

# Overview
In this project, we have employed the following key components:

VGG16 Model: We have utilized a modified version of the VGG16 neural network model, which has been updated and fine-tuned for our specific image classification task.

Dataset: Our dataset consists of fecal images collected from chickens, categorizing them into two main classes: healthy chickens and those afflicted with Coccidiosis disease.

Deployment on Microsoft Azure: We have implemented a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Microsoft Azure. This pipeline automates the deployment of our trained model, making it easily accessible and available for real-time classification.

# Usage
To utilize this image classification model, follow these steps:

Training: You can train the model further on your dataset if needed. Fine-tuning the model with your data may enhance its accuracy for specific chicken health classification tasks.
